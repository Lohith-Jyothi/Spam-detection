**SPADE MULTI-STAGE SPAM ACCOUNT DETECTION FOR ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKS**

**OVER VIEW**

In recent years, Online Social Networks (OSNs) have radically changed the way people communicate. The most widely used platforms, such as Facebook, Youtube, and Instagram, claim more than one billion monthly active users each. Beyond these, news-oriented micro-blogging services, e.g., Twitter, are daily accessed by more than 120 million users sharing contents from all over the world. Unfortunately, legitimate users of the OSNs are mixed with malicious ones, which are interested in spreading unwanted, misleading, harmful, or discriminatory content. Spam detection in OSNs is generally approached by considering the characteristics of the account under analysis, its connection with the rest of the network, as well as data and metadata representing the content shared. However, obtaining all this information can be computationally expensive, or even unfeasible, on massive networks. Driven by these motivations, in this paper we propose SpADe, a multi-stage Spam Account Detection algorithm with reject option, whose purpose is to exploit less costly features at the early stages, while progressively extracting more complex information only for those accounts that are difficult to classify. Experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared to single-stage approaches, which are much more complex in terms of features processing and classification
time.

  **REAL WORLS APPLICATIONS**
  
  Platform Security: Enhances user experience by preventing spam and malicious  activities.

  Social Media Platforms: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.,  can use SPADE to protect their networks.

  E-commerce: Detecting fake reviews and scam accounts. 

  **Conclusion**
  
  SPADE provides an advanced, multi-stage approach for spam account detection.
  By using a combination of machine learning, anomaly detection, and behavioral analysis, it achieves high accuracy in identifying spam accounts.
  The framework is adaptable and continuously improves, ensuring effective spam detection even as tactics evolve.
